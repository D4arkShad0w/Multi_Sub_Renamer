Multiple Subtitle Renaming


 Put all the subtitles of a series in one folder in the order of episodes, then give the two folders of episodes and subtitles to the software, then the names of all subtitles will be the same as all episodes, and you can   easily just Play the movie and no need to open the subtitle file.
 Enjoy!
